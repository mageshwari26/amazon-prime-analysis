# amazon-prime-analysis
This Jupyter Notebook performs an exploratory data analysis on the Amazon Prime Video dataset. It begins by loading the dataset using pandas and then provides a preview of the data's structure, including the first few rows, column names, data types, and summary statistics. The analysis further delves into the categorical data by calculating value counts for columns like type (Movie/TV Show), country, and rating.  Visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn to show the distribution of content types and top contributing countries.  Essentially, the notebook aims to provide initial insights into the characteristics and organization of the Amazon Prime Video content.
